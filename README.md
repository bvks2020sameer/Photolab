# Photolab
Project Photolab is a set of python scripts to perform various image processing on a given image . 
Image processing is a set of mathematical operations used to modify an image to highlight  a few peculiar features of an image like edges, smoothen the image , deblur the image , etc .
Image transforms are widely used in machine learning for feature engineering thereby making the process of training more efficient and reduce the time required for training a model .
