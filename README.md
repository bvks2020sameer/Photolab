# Photolab
Photolab is a Python package oriented towards various image processing techniques. It consists of various algorithms which are commonly used during various image processing techniques. Photolab takes its role in computer vision and machine learning at the feature extraction and feature engineering stage of model development. Photolab also takes caters to various image restoration techniques when a distorted image is given as an input. Thus Photolab helps one in various image processing activities like image smoothening, image sharpening, edge detection, etc. 
Project Photolab consists of algorithms classified into 5categories 

 * Edge Detection
 * Frequency Filtering
 * Spatial Image Operations
 * Image Noise
 * Image Restoration
