# Photolab 
 Photolab is a Python package to implement various image transformation techniques. 
 These transformation techniques can be mainly implemented in feature engineering during machine learning, 
 creating custom artificial neural networks, etc along with non-machine learning-based image processing approaches to a given problem. 
 It is wholly built on numpy for faster execution.   

Project Photolab consists of algorithms classified into 5
categories 

* Edge Detection
* Frequency Filtering
* Spatial Image Operations
* Image Noise
* Image Restoration
